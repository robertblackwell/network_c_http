/**
 * A read got  errno == EAGAIN and have not yet recieved a subsequent POLLIN from epoll.
 * The errno == EAGAIN may be:
 * -    nread > 0 and errno == EAGAIN - which means a partial read but there is no more
 * -    nread < 0 and errno == EAGAIN - means there was nothing to read
 * -    nread == 0 is reserved for when peer closes the socket
 *
 * This state implies a read is in progress. As only get to this state if a read
 * gets EAGAIN and a message did not complete.
 *
 * Hence nread > 0 && errno == EAGAIN and message completed which is the same as
 * input queue not empty should cause the pending read to be satisfied
 * (via posting the read callback so that it runs later) and the state to be ACTIVE
 *
 * Conditon - after sending the message to the readers callback the inputqueue should be empty.
 *
 * We should only have one message in the queue at a time
 *
 * Hence it is illegal to issue/accept a call to async_connection_read() in this state.

 * so that the input queue is NOT empty - need to decide on this signalling mechanism)
 * to signify another message has been received and has been added to the input list.
 *
 * The readers callback should be posted with the input message and the input queue
